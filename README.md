# Dopo-Frontend-II: The Sequel Nobody Asked For

Welcome to the saga of Dopo-Frontend-II, the unexpected sequel to the critically acclaimed Dopo-Frontend! üçø

### ü§î What's Going On?

Alright, buckle up because this story is a bit twisty. So, you see, once upon a coding spree, Dopo-Frontend emerged into the GitHub universe for coursework one. Everything was fine and dandy, and the code lived happily ever after... until coursework two arrived.

In a shocking turn of events, Dopo-Frontend-II was born, seemingly out of nowhere. It's like the unexpected sequel to your favorite series that you didn't even know you needed (El camino to Breaking Bad basically). Confusing? Absolutely. Necessary? Well, that's debatable.

### üöÄ The Sequel That Outgrew Its Predecessor

Dopo-Frontend-II is not just a mere continuation; it's the evolution, the next level, the avant-garde of confusion. You might wonder, "Why not just update the original?" Emm I didn't want to. üò¨

### üß≠ How to Navigate This Maze?

1. **Dopo-Frontend**: The OG version, like the first book in a series. Still here, still nostalgic.
2. **Dopo-Frontend-II**: The rebellious sequel. Bigger, bolder, and possibly weirder.
3. **Dopo-PWA**: ENDGAME (Coming Soon)

###  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why?

Why two separate repos? Well, blame it on Linus Torvalds for making it possible for me to code this stuff on my Linux computer. Thanks, Linus, for enabling this coding adventures.

### ü§î Why This Readme?

You might be wondering, "Why is there a readme for this coding chaos?" Truth be told, am as puzzled as you are. But hey, it seemed like the right thing to do (I had free time)
